This was a project that I independently designed and implemented for an Honors Seminar called Zombies in America. I had to set my own goals and stay on track to complete the project. While I was working on it, I asked friends and colleagues for their opinions on my progress and had them test what I had. I wanted to create a game that was interactive, fun, easy to play, and could go many different ways depending on the player's choices. It allowed me to integrate creativity, coding, and my knowledge of zombies into one project.
